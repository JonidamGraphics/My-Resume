    <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
    <p>I studied my bachelor of science degree in Computer Science with Mathematics at Obafemi
    Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. As a Data Analyst with over 2 years of
    experience, I have developed expertise in data analysis, data visualization, and data modeling.
    I am highly skilled in using Excel for data manipulation, and I am proficient in programming
    languages such as Python for data analysis and visualization. I have experience working with
    large datasets and conducting statistical analyses to derive meaningful insights.</p>
    <p>I have solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and data structures. I took up several
    courses in database management, machine learning, and data analytics Through these
    experiences, I have come to understand the importance of combining computer science
    principles with data analysis to make informed decisions and create impactful solutions.</p>
    <p>Currently having my master’s degree at the Moscow institute of physics and Technology, the
    department of Cyber Security (Applied Mathematics and Physics). This program has exposed
    me to real time application of data science knowledge. During the course of study, I focused
    on developing a machine learning algorithm for detecting fake news on social media. I was
    responsible for collecting and analyzing data, building predictive models, and evaluating their
    performance. I had a firsthand understanding of the challenges and rewards of applying data
    science techniques to real-world problems. I was able to learn new concepts as well as
    algorithms like, Multi-perceptron Neural network binary classifier, Gradient boosting
    classifier, Decision tree, Random forest etc in machine learning. I also had the opportunity to
    learn other interesting courses like Critical information and infrastructure, vulnerability and
    attacks, Information Security in the Cloud, Basic of network Technology, Machine learning in
    Cyber security, Fundamental of intelligent cyber security, Basic information security in
    financial organization and many others which have improve my knowledge in application of
    Mathematics for research in the field of cyber security.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about learning new techniques and technologies to stay up-to-date with the
    latest trends in the field of data analytics. I am a team player and have experience collaborating
    with cross-functional teams to achieve project goals. I am also able to work independently and
    take ownership of projects from start to finish.</p>
    <p>Overall, I am a detail-oriented, analytical, and results-driven Data Analyst with a strong track
    record of delivering insights that drive business growth and optimize operations.</p>
